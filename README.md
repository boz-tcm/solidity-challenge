# `Columbia Engineering FinTech Bootcamp 2023-06 Cohort`

## `Project: Module 20 Solidity-Challenge`

## Background
> We have recently been hired by a fintech startup company that is disrupting the finance industry with its own cross-border, Ethereum-compatible blockchain connecting financial institutions.

## Purpose
> The team currently is building smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts. To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, we'll create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Our smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
