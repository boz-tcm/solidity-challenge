# `Columbia Engineering FinTech Bootcamp 2023-06 Cohort`

## `Project: Module 20 Solidity-Challenge`

## Background
> We work at a startup thatâ€™s building a new and disruptive application named KryptoJobs2Go.

## Purpose
> Our customers will be able to use KryptoJobs2Go to find fintech professionals from a list of candidates, hire them, and then pay them. As the lead developer, we have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network within the application. The purpose is to enable our customers to instantly pay their hired fintech professionals with Ether cryptocurrency.  Our prototype will be developed using Streamlit as the front-end UI, and Ganache as our local network back-end, for purposes of testing within an emulated Ethereum blockchain network.
